# ScreenSpaceSubsurfaceScattering

![SSSS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xerxes1138/ScreenSpaceSubsurfaceScattering/master/SSS.png)

# Features
- SSS (SubSurfaceScattering) blur is performed in screen space
- SSS color attenuation can be defined by a color or a texture
- Transmittance (based on the SSS color/texture)
- Can be used on all surfaces (snow for example)

# Limitations
- Deferred shading only
- Surface shaders only (existing surface shader need to be updated, see SurfaceShaderSSSTemplate.shader and  SurfaceShaderTemplate.shader as guide)
- Not working with ambient occlusion and screen space reflection from post processing stack

# Requirements

Unity 2017.2.0f3 and a shader model 3.0 ( dx9 ) graphic card.

# How to use

Set project in Linear Color space and make sure that under ProjectSettings/Graphics it is setup like the image below

See pref_camerarig for reference on how to setup ScreenSpaceSubSurfaceScattering.cs on your camera (should always be the first effect to be used)
